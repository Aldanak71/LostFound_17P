# Lost And Found

## Project Description:
The Lost and Found  is a project developed by the 17-P team, third-year students of SDU, as part of our Advanced project for information systems course. This initiative aims to address a common challenge in our community: reuniting people with their lost items, pets, or belongings. Our mission is to create a platform that simplifies the process of sharing and finding information about lost or found items, fostering a supportive and connected community.

## Project Objectives
- **Create a User-Friendly Platform:** Develop and maintain a user-friendly website that allows community members to easily post information about lost or found items.
- **Foster Community Support:** Encourage community members to support each other in finding and reuniting with their lost items.
- **Reunite Owners with Lost Belongings:** Facilitate the reunification of lost items, pets, and belongings with their owners.
- **Promote Community Engagement:** Actively engage with the local community to promote the use of the Lost and Found Bulletin Board.
- **Provide Ongoing Support:** Continuously maintain and improve the platform to ensure it remains a valuable resource for the community.
